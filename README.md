# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features influencing house prices, such as:
- **Location**
- **Size (square footage)**
- **Number of bedrooms & bathrooms**
- **Year built**
- **Other relevant attributes**

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions
   - Finding correlations

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features
   - Selecting relevant features

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Splitting data into training and test sets
   - Training models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluating performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²
